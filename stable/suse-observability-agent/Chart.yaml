  # This fixes the release name, we fix this for ease of use of the user. Ideally we'd be able to set a default here but
  # allow the user to change this, however, ranger does not support this. If the user wants to change release name
  # that should go through helm
  catalog.cattle.io/release-name: suse-observability
  # We would like to put a default namespace here, much like the release name, but fixing both namespace and release name
  # hides does fields and allows selecting a project on rancher, which is not what we want. For now this is configurable.
